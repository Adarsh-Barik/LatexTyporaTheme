# Latex Theme for Typora
Makes typora looks like latex generated pdf

# Some syntax
* `#` - Chapter heading/Title/First heading (centered)
* `##` - Subtitle/Second heading (centered, looks like subtitle)
* `###` - Section heading

# Notes
* Use of `#` (Chapter heading) in the middle of the page will cause a page break and title will appear in the next page. This is by design as I like to keep separate titles in their separate pages.
